# attrakttv

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Just a packaged shiny app relying on [{tRakt}](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt) to get data out of https://trakt.tv and display it nicely.

You can find it currently deployed at [attrakttv.tadaa-data.de](https://attrakttv.tadaa-data.de/).

Please open an issue if you encounter crashes.  

## Installation

You can install the latest version of attrakttv from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install("jemus42/attrakttv")
```

## Usage (Local)

The app needs both credentials for the **trakt.tv** and the **fanart.tv** API, see `attrakttv.env-sample` for reference. Plug in your keys and either rename the file to `.Renviron` in the current working directory or copy these values to your user/global `.Renviron`.

Then you can call `attrakttv::attrakttv_app()` and try to add a show, which will then hopefully open a browser window displaying a trakt.tv PIN for you to enter at the R console.  
You can also achieve this by calling any data-retrieving function from the `{tRakt}` package.

The the downloaded show data is stored in a SQLite database located under `~/.local/attrakttv/db/tRakt.db` by default, but you can change that value via the aforementioned configuration file.

## Usage (Docker)

Since this thing requires API keys for both https://trakt.tv and https://fanart.tv, you'll need to create accounts and get credentials for those first.  
Copy the file via `cp attrakttv.env-sample attrakttv.env` and plug in your values.

Next you'll need to create a `{httr}` OAuth2 token. The easiest way is to call some function from `{tRakt}` that uses the trakt.tv API (e.g. `tRakt::search_query("Counterpart")`) which will then prompt you for an authentication PIN and open a corresponding browser window. Once set up, the token should be located at `.httr-oauth`.  

Once both `attrakttv.env` and `.httr-oauth` you can run

```
docker build -t attrakttv .
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 --run-as=shiny attrakttv
```

And the app will be running at `localhost:3838`.

Note that currently the SQLite database is ephemeral.  
You can use `docker-compose` with the included `docker-compose.yml` which will put the database in a volume called `trakt_db`. This is mapped to a local volume you have to define via environment variable set in `.env`, so `cp .env-sample .env` and plug in your desired path (which **must exist**).
