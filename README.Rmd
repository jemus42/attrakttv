# attrakttv

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Just a packaged shiny app relying on [{tRakt}](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt) to get data out of https://trakt.tv and display it nicely.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of attrakttv from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install("jemus42/attrakttv")
```

## Docker

Since this thing requires API keys for both https://trakt.tv and https://fanart.tv, you'll need to create accounts and get credentials for those first.  
Then plug them into `attrakttv.env-sample` and rename it to `attrakttv.env`.

Next you'll need to create a `{httr}` OAuth2 token. The easiest way is to call some function from `{tRakt}` that uses the trakt.tv API (e.g. `tRakt::search_query("Counterpart")`) which will then prompt you for an authentication PIN and open a corresponding browser window. Once set up, the token should be located at `.httr-oauth`.  

Once both `attrakttv.env` and `.httr-oauth` you can run

```
docker build -t attrakttv .
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 --run-as=shiny attrakttv
```

And the app will be running at `localhost:3838`.

Note that currently the SQLite database is ephemeral.  
You can use `docker-compose` with the included `docker-compose.yml` which will put the database in a volume called `trakt_db`.  
I'm still figuring out what to do with that. Not that the database isn't easily recreatable (and would ideally need regular updating of outdated data anyway), but still.
